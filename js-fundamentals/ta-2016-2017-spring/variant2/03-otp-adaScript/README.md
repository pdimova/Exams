# Otp-adaScript

## Description

Otp-adaScript is a revolutionary language for defining enumerations. Each enumeration has a name and contains at least one name. Each name has a value - **a non-negative integer**.

Your task is to write a program which finds out the value of each constant:

```
NAME = VALUE :: ENUMERATION;
NAME = VALUE :: ENUMERATION;
...
```

Output lines should be **lexicographically sorted**.

### Rules of Otp-adaScript

#### Defining enumerations

* Syntax:

```
<Colors>
    BLACK;
    RED;
    GREEN;
    BLUE;
    WHITE = 7;
</>
```

* `<Colors>` - Indicates definition of enumeration named `Colors`
* `</>` indicates end of definition
* `WHITE = 7;` defines a constant named `WHITE` with value of `7`
* `BLACK;` defines a constant named `BLACK`, value is **the smallest unused non-negative integer inside the enumeration**
  - Values inside enumerations **are different from each other**
* _Examples:_

```
<Colors>
    BLACK;              ( = 0 )
    RED;                ( = 1 )
    GREEN;              ( = 2 )
    BLUE;               ( = 3 )
    WHITE = 7;          ( = 7 )
</>
```

```
<Fruit>
    Apple;              ( = 0 )
    Banana;             ( = 1 )
    Pineapple;          ( = 2 )
</>
<Vegetable>
    Cucumber = 1;       ( = 1 )
    Cabage;             ( = 0 )
</>
```

#### Shared enumerations

* Syntax (the same with `@`):

```
<@Colors>
    BLACK;
    RED;
    GREEN;
    BLUE;
    WHITE = 7;
</>
```

* They work in exactly the same way
  - Values inside them **are different from each other**
  - Values inside them **are different from values inside other shared enumerations**
* _Examples:_

```
<@Fruit>
    Apple;              ( = 0 )
    Banana;             ( = 2 )
    Pineapple;          ( = 3 )
</>
<@Vegetable>
    Cucumber = 1;       ( = 1 )
    Cabage;             ( = 4 )
</>
```

```
<@Languages>
    CSharp;             ( = 0 )
    JavaScript;         ( = 1 )
    Haskell = 42;       ( = 42 )
    Rust = 4;           ( = 4 )
    CPP;                ( = 3 )
</>
<Result>
    Failed;             ( = 0 )
    Passed;             ( = 1 )
    Excellence;         ( = 2 )
</>
<@Insects>
    Ant;                ( = 5 )
    Mosquito = 2;       ( = 2 )
</>
```

## Input

* Input will be consisted of an array containing lines of Otp-adaScript
  - Each line will be either beginning or ending of declaration or constant definition
  - There will not be empty lines
* _Note:_ There can be any amount of whitespace around `=` and `;`, in the beginning or the end of each line
* _The input will always be valid and in the described format. There is no need to validate it explicitly._

## Output

* Output each constant with its value in the format:

```
NAME = VALUE :: ENUM;
```

## Constraints

* Enumeration and constant names are consisted only of latin letters and numbers
* All enumerations and constants will have different names
* **Time limit: 0.3 s**
* **Memory limit: 16 MB*

## Sample tests

### Sample Test 1

#### Input

```js
[
    '<Fruit>',
    '  Apple;',
    '  Banana;',
    '  Pineapple;',
    '</>',
    '<Vegetable>',
    '  Cucumber = 1;',
    '  Cabage;',
    '</>'
]
```

#### Output

```
Apple = 0 :: Fruit;
Banana = 1 :: Fruit;
Cabage = 0 :: Vegetable;
Cucumber = 1 :: Vegetable;
Pineapple = 2 :: Fruit;
```

### Sample Test 2

#### Input

```js
[
    '<@Languages>',
    '   CSharp;',
    '   JavaScript;',
    '   Haskell = 42;',
    '   Rust = 4;',
    '   CPP;',
    '</>',
    '<Result>',
    '   Failed;',
    '   Passed;',
    '   Excellence;',
    '</>',
    '<@Insects>',
    '   Ant;',
    '   Mosquito = 2;',
    '</>'
]
```

#### Output

```
Ant = 5 :: Insects;
CPP = 3 :: Languages;
CSharp = 0 :: Languages;
Excellence = 2 :: Result;
Failed = 0 :: Result;
Haskell = 42 :: Languages;
JavaScript = 1 :: Languages;
Mosquito = 2 :: Insects;
Passed = 1 :: Result;
Rust = 4 :: Languages;
```
